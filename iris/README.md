# My Python Project

## Overview
This project implements a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) on the Iris dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The main code is located in `src/week1.py`, which handles data loading, model fitting, and visualization of the clustering results.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-python-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the main code, execute the following command:
```
python src/week1.py
```

This will load the Iris dataset, apply PCA, fit a Gaussian Mixture Model, and display the original and GMM clusters using matplotlib.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

Make sure to install these packages before running the code.
